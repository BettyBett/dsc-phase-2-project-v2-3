### Overview.
This project will predict the housing prices in King County.

## Business Problem.
There are many households who would like to purchase houses around King County, but due to the information asymmetry in the market they go into it blindly. Therefore to mitigate that gap in the market, we are going to study some data on the sale of houses that took place between the year 2014 to 2015, within King County.

Our project aims at proiding consultation to a real estate agency that helps households purchase houses. And through studying the data we will provide a way in which one can predict the prices of the houses.

### Analysis.
The square footage of living space is one of the most influential factors when it comes to determining the value of a property. It was discovered that it has the highest correlation with price.
